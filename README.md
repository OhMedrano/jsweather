 This is made on the boilerplate I made for myself 


 		Javascript Weather 


 I wanted to learn more on how to write in javascript. This whole project just depends on js files, no frameworks aside from jquery for some bootstrap stuff.



 All graphics are done by me. 

 

 1/29/17- 

 		Got a lot of stuff done from the last time I updated this. 

 		I'm using app.js as a reference for some old code ideas, app2.js 
 		the active js file right now. 

 		So currently, I have this getting the location data, requesting the
 		weather data, and being able to display it. 

 		I was able to link the cloud density with the actual clouds that get rendered. 


 		Right now I'm just having an issue with displaying the clouds. 
 		The commented code under the Starfield.property.draw() function,
 		can render blocks of clouds (solid white blocks). 

 		I want to render the cloud images I made on illustrator (Which look
 		pretty good IMO.). The current code works, however it constantly
 		flashes, and leaves a weird image trail. Tbh, I'm not sure what's 
 		the exact term I'm looking for, I'll go ask around on stack or 
 		reddit.


 		Another problem is dealing with webpack, it's having a weird time 
 		bundling the scss.
